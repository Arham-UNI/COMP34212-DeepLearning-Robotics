# COMP34212 Deep Learning and Robotics Coursework

This repository contains the code and experiments for the COMP34212 coursework on Deep Learning and Robotics. The project aims to explore the application of deep neural networks (DNN) in robotics, particularly focusing on vision recognition tasks.

## Coursework Tasks:
1. **Literature Review**: Analyzing the role of deep learning models in various robotics applications.
2. **Deep Learning Experimentation**: Extending lab exercises to train and evaluate deep learning models (MLP, CNN) for object recognition using datasets like CIFAR, COCO, iCub World, and RGB-D Object Dataset.

The project explores the impact of hyperparameter tuning and training strategies on the performance of deep learning models in robotics vision tasks. The results, along with a comprehensive analysis of the experiments, will be presented in the accompanying report.
